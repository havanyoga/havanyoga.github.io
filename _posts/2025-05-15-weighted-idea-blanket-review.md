## 🧪 Real-World Experience

We found the Weighted Idea blanket **surprisingly comfortable** given its low price point. The stitching holds the glass beads in place well, and the feel is soft but structured.

It doesn’t have the luxury feel of higher-end models like Gravity, but for a basic calming effect, it delivers more than expected. Some hot sleepers may still want a more breathable cotton option.
