## 🌿 What Makes Lavender So Effective for Sleep?

Lavender contains compounds like **linalool** and **linalyl acetate** — both shown to have relaxing effects on the nervous system. These compounds help:

* Lower heart rate and blood pressure
* Reduce anxiety and overthinking
* Promote a sense of calm, preparing your brain for rest

Several clinical studies have found that lavender aromatherapy can significantly improve sleep quality, especially in people with mild insomnia or stress.

Diffusing essential oils allows the aroma to gently fill your room. When inhaled, lavender's compounds interact with your limbic system — the brain’s emotional center — which helps quiet the mind.

Many people report falling asleep faster and waking up fewer times during the night when using a diffuser consistently.
