## 💬 Real-World Experience

The first night using Dodow was a pleasant surprise. I didn’t expect a pulsing light to make such a difference, but focusing on the expanding blue circle shifted my attention away from thoughts.

By the third night, my time to fall asleep had dropped significantly. I used to take over 45 minutes — now I’m usually asleep before the 8-minute cycle ends. It’s like training your body to relax again.
