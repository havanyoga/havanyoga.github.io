# I Couldn’t Sleep for Weeks – Until I Tried White Noise

There were nights I only slept 2 or 3 hours. I’d fall asleep around midnight, only to wake at 3am—wide awake and restless.

It wasn’t loud. In fact, it was too quiet. But my brain? Loud as ever.

I tried herbal teas. I stopped looking at screens. I even forced myself into guided meditations that made me more annoyed than relaxed.  
**Nothing worked.**

## Then I Tried White Noise

At first, I thought it was a gimmick.  
“Just noise? That’s supposed to help?”

But I was desperate.

I downloaded a free app and set it to “fan” mode. And… something shifted.

Suddenly, I didn’t hear the cars outside. Or the ticking of the wall clock.  
All I heard was a soft, steady shhhhhh that **blanketed my thoughts**.

## My Sleep Transformed in Just a Few Nights

After three nights, I was no longer waking up at 3am.  
By the end of the week, I was sleeping 6 to 7 hours **straight through**—something I hadn’t done in months.

It wasn’t magic. It was white noise.

## From App to Actual Machine

Once I realized how powerful it was, I wanted better sound. Apps were okay, but they felt digital, a bit artificial.

So I did what I always do—**read dozens of reviews**, watched YouTube demos, and narrowed it down to a few white noise machines.

## The One I Chose (and Still Use)

I finally picked a machine that uses a real fan instead of recorded loops. It’s simple, small, and fits right by my nightstand.

If you’re looking to try it too, these are the three I considered:

## Is It for Everyone?

Maybe not.

But if you’ve tried everything, and nothing seems to stop your brain from spinning at night—**try white noise**.  
It gave me back quiet. It gave me rest.

It gave me my nights again.
