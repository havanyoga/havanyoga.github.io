## 🧪 Real-World Experience

Users consistently praise how **grounded** and **still** they feel under the Gravity Blanket. The sensation of weight calms fidgeting and helps people drift into deeper sleep more quickly. It’s particularly helpful for those with anxiety or high-stress lifestyles.

However, some users note that it can **trap heat**, making it less ideal for hot sleepers — especially without AC. If temperature is your concern, the [ZonLi Weighted Blanket](/2025-05-15-zonli-weighted-blanket-review/) may be a better fit.
