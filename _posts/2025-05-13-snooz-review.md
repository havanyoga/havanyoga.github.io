## 💬 Real-World Experience

I’ve used many white noise apps and machines, but the **SNOOZ machine** is the first that truly helped me sleep through city traffic and hallway noise. The real fan sound feels more natural, and I forget it's even running.

The app was quick to pair and very convenient — I set it to start every night at 10 PM and wake off at 6:30 AM. No beeps, no bright lights. Just peaceful, real airflow sound.
