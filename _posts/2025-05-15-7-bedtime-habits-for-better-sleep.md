A good night‚Äôs sleep doesn‚Äôt start when your head hits the pillow‚Äîit begins long before that, with the habits you build into your evening routine. If you often struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep through the night, tweaking your pre-sleep rituals might make a world of difference.

Here are **7 simple, natural bedtime habits** that can improve your sleep quality and help you wake up refreshed.

---

## 1. Power down electronics 30 minutes before bed

Blue light from phones, tablets, and computers suppresses melatonin production ‚Äî the hormone that regulates your sleep-wake cycle. When melatonin is low, it‚Äôs harder for your brain to recognize that it‚Äôs time to sleep.

> **Research Insight**: A Harvard study found that blue light exposure at night suppresses melatonin for about twice as long as green light and shifts circadian rhythms by twice as much. [(source)](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side)

### How to apply this tip:
- Set a "digital curfew" at least 30‚Äì60 minutes before bedtime.
- Use features like **Night Shift (iOS)**, **Night Light (Windows)**, or apps like **f.lux** on computers.
- Replace scrolling with paper reading, journaling, or listening to soft music.

Even dimming overhead lights and switching to warmer bulbs (2,700K or less) in the evening can cue your brain to wind down naturally.

## 2. Use a pillow that supports your neck and spine

When your neck and spine are not properly supported during sleep, your muscles stay tense, causing discomfort and restlessness. Over time, this leads to disrupted sleep cycles and early morning aches.

> **Health Tip**: The American Chiropractic Association recommends using a pillow that supports the natural curve of your neck, especially if you‚Äôre a side or back sleeper.

### What to look for:
- Adjustable loft or fill (especially memory foam)
- Breathable materials to reduce sweating
- Ergonomic design that aligns head, neck, and shoulders

## 3. Block out all sources of light

- Wearing a high-quality sleep mask
- Removing LED lights or using blackout curtains

## 4. Keep your bedroom cool (65‚Äì72¬∞F)

Temperature plays a critical role in how quickly you fall asleep and how long you stay asleep. Your core body temperature naturally drops during the night, and a cooler room supports that process.

> **Did you know?** The optimal bedroom temperature for most people is between 60¬∞F and 67¬∞F (15.6¬∞C to 19.4¬∞C), according to the Sleep Foundation. [(source)](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/temperature)

### Tips to keep cool:
- Set your air conditioner or fan to 65‚Äì72¬∞F
- Use breathable bedding made from cotton or bamboo
- Try a cool mist diffuser with eucalyptus or mint oil

## 5. Listen to white noise or calming sounds

White noise is a consistent sound that masks sudden changes in ambient noise ‚Äî like a door closing or a car passing by ‚Äî which can disturb your sleep.

> **Fun Fact**: According to the Sleep Foundation, white noise can help people fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper, more continuous sleep. [(source)](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/noise-and-sleep/white-noise)

### White noise vs. pink noise:
- **White noise**: Even intensity across frequencies (e.g., static, fan sound)
- **Pink noise**: More balanced, natural feel (e.g., rustling leaves, rain)

üéß Bonus tip: Use a timer to auto-shut the sound machine after 1‚Äì2 hours if you‚Äôre a light sleeper.

## 6. Use calming scents to unwind

Aromatherapy can ease stress and promote relaxation. Try diffusing essential oils like lavender, chamomile, or eucalyptus.

## 7. Build a consistent bedtime routine

Your body thrives on rhythm. Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day helps reinforce your **circadian rhythm**, making it easier to fall asleep and wake up naturally.

> **Did you know?** The National Institute of Neurological Disorders states that irregular sleep schedules disrupt your internal clock and lead to insomnia-like symptoms. [(source)](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/circadian-rhythm-sleep-disorders)

### Evening routine ideas:
- Light stretching or gentle yoga (10 minutes)
- Simple skincare or warm shower
- Reading fiction or journaling

Consistency cues your brain: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to wind down.‚Äù

A bedtime routine doesn‚Äôt have to be elaborate ‚Äî what matters most is **doing it consistently every night**.
