A good night’s sleep doesn’t start when your head hits the pillow—it begins long before that, with the habits you build into your evening routine. If you often struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep through the night, tweaking your pre-sleep rituals might make a world of difference.

Here are **7 simple, natural bedtime habits** that can improve your sleep quality and help you wake up refreshed.

---

## 1. Power down electronics 30 minutes before bed

Blue light from phones and computers suppresses melatonin production, making it harder for your body to relax. Instead, try:
- Reading a paper book
- Journaling
- Listening to calming white noise (see habit #5)

## 2. Use a pillow that supports your neck and spine

A poor sleep posture can cause neck pain and disrupt your sleep. A high-quality, adjustable pillow can improve comfort dramatically.

## 3. Block out all sources of light

Even small amounts of light can interfere with your REM sleep. Keep your bedroom dark by:
- Wearing a high-quality sleep mask
- Removing LED lights or using blackout curtains

## 4. Keep your bedroom cool (65–72°F)

Lowering your body temperature naturally signals your body that it’s time to sleep. Use a fan, air conditioner, or even a cool mist diffuser.

## 5. Listen to white noise or calming sounds

White noise helps mask background sounds that may wake you up at night. Consider investing in a compact sound machine.
