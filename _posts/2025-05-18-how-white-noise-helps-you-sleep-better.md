## What Is White Noise?

White noise is a sound that includes all frequencies the human ear can hear, playing at equal intensity. It typically sounds like a constant "shhh"â€”similar to a fan, static, or steady rainfall. There are also other types like pink noise and brown noise, each with different frequency emphasis.

## The Science of Sleep and Sound

Sudden sounds like car horns, barking dogs, or hallway chatter can disrupt your sleep, even if you donâ€™t fully wake up. These sounds trigger startle responses in your brain, increasing heart rate and breaking sleep cycles. White noise creates a stable auditory environment that masks those disruptions and helps maintain deep sleep.

## How White Noise Improves Sleep Quality

- **Blocks sudden noise**: White noise masks environmental interruptions.
- **Supports deep sleep**: Stable background sound promotes longer slow-wave sleep phases.
- **Reduces night wakings**: Fewer abrupt awakenings from unpredictable noise.

## What Studies Say

Scientific studies support the use of white noise for better sleep. One study found that white noise helped people in noisy environments fall asleep faster and spend more time in deep sleep. Another showed that hospitalized patients exposed to white noise reported higher sleep satisfaction and fewer disturbances.

## Best Ways to Use White Noise

- **Use a white noise machine**: Dedicated devices offer high-quality non-looping sound.
- **Use mobile apps**: Many apps provide various white and ambient noises.
- **Try a fan**: Some people rely on the hum of a fan as a natural white noise source.
